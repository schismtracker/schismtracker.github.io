            <p>
                <b>Schism Tracker</b> is a free and open-source reimplementation of <a
                href="https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Impulse-Tracker">Impulse
                Tracker</a>, a program used to create high quality music without the
                requirements of specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique
                "finger feel" that is difficult to replicate in part. The player is
                based on a highly modified version of the <a
                href="https://openmpt.org/legacy_software">ModPlug</a> engine, with a
                number of bugfixes and changes to <a
                href="https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Player-abuse-tests">improve IT
                playback</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where Impulse Tracker was limited to i386-based systems running MS-DOS,
                Schism Tracker runs on almost any platform that <a
                href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> supports, and has been
                successfully built for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
                AmigaOS, BeOS, and even <a
                href="http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Schism_Tracker">the Wii</a>. Schism
                will most likely build on any architecture supported by GCC4 (e.g.
                alpha, m68k, arm, etc.) but it will probably not be as well-optimized
                on many systems.
